# Cloud User Meeting: BiBiGrid Hands-on

This tutorial is a reworked/optimized version of the Hands-on session of the **GCB 2019 in Heidelberg**
based on the latest release of BiBiGrid

## Prerequisites

- System base on Linux, OSX (tested) or Windows Subsystem for Linux (untested)
- required software packages 
  - Python > 3.6  
  - git (required)
  - openssh 
- Openstack API access 
- [OpenstackClient](https://pypi.org/project/python-openstackclient/) (recommended)

## Download BiBiGrid
```shell
git clone https://github.com/BiBiServ/bibigrid.git
cd bibigrid
```

The following steps assume that you are inside of the bibigrid folder. It should contain:

```
$ ls
bibigrid  bibigrid_rest.sh  bibigrid.sh  bibigrid.yml  documentation  README.md  requirements-dev.txt  requirements-rest.txt  requirements.txt  resources  tests
```

## What will happen...

The goal of this session is to set up a small HPC cluster consisting of 3 nodes (1 master, 2 workers) using BiBiGrid with [Slurm](https://slurm.schedmd.com/quickstart.html) (workload manager), [Network File System](https://linux.die.net/man/5/nfs) (allows file sharing between servers) and [Theia](https://theia-ide.org/docs/user_getting_started/) (Web IDE). This tutorial targets users running BiBiGrid on de.NBI cloud.

1. [Preparation](#preparation)
2. [Configuration](#configuration)
3. [The Cluster](#the-cluster)

## Preparation

### Premade Template

Use the prefilled configuration template [resources/bibigrid.yml](resources/bibigrid.yml) as a basis for your personal BiBiGrid configuration. 
Later in this tutorial you will use [OpenStackClient](https://pypi.org/project/python-openstackclient/) or access 
Openstack's dashboard manually to get all necessary configuration information from your project.

Copy the [configuration template](resources/bibigrid.yml) to `~/.config/bibigrid/`.

### Authentication

In this section you will create an [application credential](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/zh-cn/red_hat_openstack_platform/14/html/users_and_identity_management_guide/application_credentials) and download the autogenerated `clouds.yaml`. `clouds.yaml` contains all required authentication information. Follow the images:

![Navigation](images/ac_screen1.png)

Don't use the input field secret.
- Its input is not hidden
- OpenStack will generate a strong secret for you, if you leave it blank.

Pick a sensible expiration date.

![Creation](images/ac_screen2.png)

Safe the downloaded `clouds.yaml` under `~/.config/openstack/` **and** `~/.config/bibigrid/`. That will allow both OpenstackClient and BiBiGrid to access it.

<details>
<summary>Why not store BiBiGrids `clouds.yaml` in openstack and save the extra copy?</summary>

In the future BiBiGrid will support more than just one cloud infrastructure. Therefore, using the `~/.config/openstack` folder would be a disadvantage later.
</details>

![Download](images/ac_screen3.png)

If you have OpenstackClient installed, try executing `openstack subnet list --os-cloud=openstack`. If it runs without errors, you are ready to proceed.

### Virtual Environment

A virtual environment is something that gives you everything you need to run specific programs without altering your system.

#### Creating a [Virtual Python Environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html)

`python3 -m venv ~/.venv/bibigrid`

#### Sourcing Environments

In order to actually use the virtual environment we need to [source](https://www.theunixschool.com/2012/04/what-is-sourcing-file.html) that environment:

`source ~/.venv/bibigrid/bin/activate`

Following [pip](https://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/bionic/en/man1/pip.1.html) installations will only affect the virtual environment. The virtual environment is only `sourced` in the terminal where you executed the source command. Other terminals are not affected.

#### Fulfilling Requirements

You will now install packages required by BiBiGrid within your newly created virtual environment. If you haven't `sourced` your environment yet, please go [back](#sourcing-environments). To install all BiBiGrid requirements, we simply install from the given requirements file:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Configuration

Following the next steps you will update the [premade template](#premade-template).

<details>
<summary>Why are some keys in the template already set?</summary>

In this hands-on, we want to make things as easy as possible for you. Just check whether the key you've found is the correct one and matches with the one we've written down in the configuration file already.
</details>

### SSH access information

BiBiGrid needs to know which [sshUser](https://www.redhat.com/sysadmin/access-remote-systems-ssh) to use in order to connect to your master. You can set this key in your `~/.config/bibigrid/bibigrid.yml` file. 

The [sshUser](https://www.redhat.com/sysadmin/access-remote-systems-ssh) depends on your server image. Since we run on top of Ubuntu 22.04 the ssh-user is `ubuntu`. Set the template's `sshUser` key to `ubuntu`.

### Network

We have created a subnet for this workshop for you. Determine your subnet's `Name` by running:

```
openstack subnet list --os-cloud=openstack
```

Set the template's `subnet` key to the result's `Name` key.

### Instances

BiBiGrid needs to know `type` and `image` for each server. Since those are often identical for the workers, 
you can simply use the `count` key to indicate multiple workers with the same `type` and `image`.

#### Image
Images are virtual disks with a bootable operating system. Choosing an image means choosing the operating 
system of your server.

Since [images](https://docs.openstack.org/image-guide/introduction.html) are often updated, you need to 
look up the current active image using:

```shell
openstack image list --os-cloud=openstack | grep active
```

Since we will use Ubuntu 22.04 you might as well use:

```shell
openstack image list --os-cloud=openstack | grep active | grep "Ubuntu 22.04"
```

Set the template's `image` key of all instances to the result's `ID`  **or** `NAME` entry of the Ubuntu 22.04 row. 
All servers will share the same image.

<details>
<summary>Do I have to update my configuration file whenever there is a new image version?</summary>

If you use the method described above, yes. However, you can also use a regex instead of a specific name to select an image during runtime. This has also avoids issues that may arise whenever an image is deactivated while your cluster is still running. For our Ubuntu 22.04 images you could use `^Ubuntu 22\.04 LTS \(.*\)$`, but usually you need to check what image names are available at your location and choose the regex accordingly. For more information on this functionality take a look at BiBiGrids [full documentation](https://github.com/BiBiServ/bibigrid/blob/master/documentation/markdown/features/configuration.md#using-regex).
</details>

#### Flavor

Flavors are available hardware configurations.

The following gives you a list of all flavors:

```shell
openstack flavor list --os-cloud=openstack
```

Set the template's `flavor` keys (provide an `ID` or `NAME` - we will use `NAME` in the following examples) to flavors of your choice - in this tutorial we will use `de.NBI medium` for our master and `de.NBI small` for our two workers. You can use a different flavor for the master and each worker-group.

<details>
<summary>Example: Multiple worker groups</summary>

The key `workerInstances` expects a list. Each list element is a `worker group` with an `image` + `type` combination and a `count`. In our tutorial we use a single worker group containing two workers. Since they are in the same worker group, they are identical in flavor and image. We could, however, define two worker groups with one worker each in order to use different flavors for them.

```shell
workerInstances:
  - type: de.NBI tiny
    image: ubuntu-22.04-image-name
    count: 1
  - type: de.NBI default
    image: ubuntu-22.04-image-name
    count: 1
```
</details>

### Waiting for post-launch Services

Some clouds run one or more post-launch services on every started instance, to finish the initialization after an 
instance is available (e.g. to configure local proxy settings or local available repositories). That might interrupt 
BiBiGrid setting up the node (via Ansible). Therefore, BiBiGrid needs to wait for your post-launch service(s) to finish. For that BiBiGrid needs the 
services' names. Set the key `waitForServices` to the list of services you would like to wait for. For Bielefeld 
this would be `de.NBI_Bielefeld_environment.service`. In the future you should be able to find post-launch service names by 
taking a look at your location's [Computer Center Specific](https://cloud.denbi.de/wiki/) site - if 
post-launch services exist for your location.

```yaml
  waitForServices: 
    - de.NBI_Bielefeld_environment.service
```


### Check Your Configuration
Run `./bibigrid.sh -i bibigrid.yml -ch -v` to check your configuration. The command line argument 
`-v` allows for greater verbosity which will make it easier for you to fix issues.

## The Cluster
### Starting the cluster
`./bibigrid.sh -i bibigrid.yml -c -v` creates the cluster with a more verbose output. Cluster creation time 
depends on the chosen flavor and the overall load of the cloud and will take up to 15 minutes.

### List Running Cluster
Since several clusters can run simultaneously, listing all running clusters can be useful:

Execute `./bibigrid.sh -i bibigrid.yml -l`. You will receive a general overview over all clusters started 
in your project.

### Cluster SSH Connection

After a successful setup, BiBiGrid will print some information. For example:

```
Cluster 6jh83w0n3vsip90 with master 123.45.67.890 up and running!
SSH: ssh -i '~/.bibigrid/tempKey_bibi-6jh83w0n3vsip90' ubuntu@123.45.67.890
Terminate cluster: ./bibigrid.sh -i 'bibigrid.yml' -t -cid 6jh83w0n3vsip90
Detailed cluster info: ./bibigrid.sh -i 'bibigrid.yml' -l -cid 6jh83w0n3vsip90
```

You can now establish an SSH connection to your cluster's master by executing the `SSH` line of your `create`'s 
output: 
```shell
ssh -i '~/.bibigrid/keys/tempKey_bibi-6jh83w0n3vsip90' ubuntu@123.45.67.890 
```
But make sure to use the one generated for you by BiBiGrid since 

- cluster-id (here `6jh83w0n3vsip90`), 
- key name (here `~/.config/bibigrid/keys/tempKey_bibi-6jh83w0n3vsip90`) 
- user@IP (here `ubuntu@123.45.67.890`) 

will differ on every run. Run `sinfo` after logging in. You should see something like this:

```
PARTITION AVAIL  TIMELIMIT  NODES  STATE NODELIST
openstack    up   infinite      2  idle~ bibigrid-worker-6jh83w0n3vsip90-[0-1]
openstack    up   infinite      1   idle bibigrid-master-6jh83w0n3vsip90
All*         up   infinite      2  idle~ bibigrid-worker-6jh83w0n3vsip90-[0-1]
All*         up   infinite      1   idle bibigrid-master-6jh83w0n3vsip90
```

However, doing everything on the running cluster from a terminal can be quite bothersome. That's were Theia comes in.

<details>
<summary>Why are there two partitions (openstack and all) with the same nodes?</summary>

BiBiGrid creates one partition for every cloud (here `openstack`) and one partition called `all` containing all nodes from all partitions. Since we are only using one cloud for this tutorial, we only have `openstack` and `all`.
</details>

### Using Theia Web IDE

[Theia Web IDE's](https://www.theia-ide.org/) many features make it easier to work on your cloud instances. Take a look:

![Theia](images/theia.png)


When enabled, Theia Web IDE is configured to listen on localhost port 8181 on the master instance. Since this address 
is not directly available you have to forward it to your machine using ssh. Execute 

```shell
./bibigrid.sh -i bibigrid.yml -ide -cid [cluster-id]
```

to connect to Theia. You may even use `./bibigrid.sh -i bibigrid.yml -ide` since BiBiGrid will attempt to connect to your last created cluster if no cluster-id is given. Theia will be run as `systemd service` on localhost. A Theia IDE tab will be automatically opened in your browser.

## Hello BiBiGrid, Hello Antibiotic Resistance!

In this section, you will execute the `resFinder` workflow to create a heatmap of antibiotic resistances using your cluster. We will only focus on the workflow language [Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io/) within this tutorial. However, you could use any software that comes with a SLURM executor instead or even run the jobs directly through SLURM's CLI.

<details>
<summary>Digression: Job Scheduling (SLURM)</summary>

[Slurm](https://slurm.schedmd.com/) is used for job scheduling/workload management. To see all nodes in your cluster execute `sinfo`. You will notice that workers are `idle~`. That means they are `idle` and `~` (powered down). Slurm uses many symbols and words to indicate node states. See [here](https://slurm.schedmd.com/sinfo.html#SECTION_NODE-STATE-CODES) for more about that. To see all running jobs, execute `squeue`. You will notice that no job is currently running.

After successfully connecting to Theia IDE, we will now run our first job on our cluster. Let's start with a "hello world".

- Open a terminal

- Create a new shell script `nano /vol/spool/helloworld.sh`:

```shell
#!/bin/bash
echo Hello from $(hostname) !
sleep 10
```

- Make `helloworld.sh` executable using [chmod](https://linux.die.net/man/1/chmod): `chmod u+x /vol/spool/helloworld.sh`
- Change into the /vol/spool/ directory: `cd /vol/spool/`
- Submit this script as an array job 50 times : `sbatch --array=1-50 --job-name=helloworld helloworld.sh` (run the job 50 times). The job `helloworld` runs now. It will take a while to finish, but you can already inspect some information while it runs.
- The master will now power up worker nodes (as you described it in `bibigrid.yml`) to assist him with this job. Execute `sinfo` after a few seconds to see the current node status.
- View information about all scheduled jobs by executing `squeue`. You will see your job `helloworld` there.
- You can see `helloworld`'s output using [cat](https://linux.die.net/man/1/cat) `cat /vol/spool/slurm-*.out`.
</details>

### Setting up nextflow

#### Install Java

```shell
sudo apt install default-jre
```

#### Download Nextflow into your /vol/spool folder

```shell
cd /vol/spool
wget -qO- https://get.nextflow.io | bash
```

#### Get and execute resFinder
Execute locally in this repository's folder in order to copy our test workflow to the master (use your own key path and master ip)

```shell
scp -i '~/.bibigrid/keys/tempKey_bibi-6jh83w0n3vsip90' resources/Resistance_Nextflow.tar.xz ubuntu@123.45.67.890 :/vol/spool/Resistance_Nextflow.tar.xz
```

Execute on remote within `/vol/spool` in order to unpack our workflow and run it on the master.

```shell
tar -xvf Resistance_Nextflow.tar.xz
./nextflow run resFinder.nf
```

Using `squeue` in another terminal will show you that this execution is not running on our slurm cluster.

##### On Slurm

In order to run our workflow on our slurm cluster, we need to set the executor to slurm. We have done that using a profile definition (see `nextflow.config`).

```shell
./nextflow run resFinder.nf -profile slurm
```

Once our workflow has finished, we can see the generated heatmap in `outputs/collected_heatmaps/`.

## Terminate a cluster

Terminating a running cluster is quite simple. Execute `./bibigrid.sh -i bibigrid.yml -t -cid [cluster-id] -v`. 
You have probably already guessed it, `./bibigrid.sh -i bibigrid.yml -t` also does the trick, since BiBiGrid will fall 
back on your last created cluster if no cluster-id is specified.

## Moving Forward: Further Explorations

Congratulations! You have finished BiBiGrid's Hands-on.

You may want to take a look at the "real" `bibigrid.yml` inside BiBiGrid's repository. It has a few more keys. However, everything you learned here stays true.

If you would like to deepen your knowledge maybe give BiBiGrid's [Features](https://gitlab.ub.uni-bielefeld.de/bibiserv/bibigrid/bibigrid2/-/blob/main/documentation/markdown/bibigrid_feature_list.md) or the [Software](https://gitlab.ub.uni-bielefeld.de/bibiserv/bibigrid/bibigrid2/-/blob/main/documentation/markdown/bibigrid_software_list.md) used by BiBiGrid a read.

### Ansible
Ansible, an open source community project by Red Hat, enables the idempotent setup of servers - installing software you need and so on. Knowing more about Ansible can be very helpful when handling clusters. You can learn more about Ansible here:
